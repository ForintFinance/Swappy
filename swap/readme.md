Swappy is a product developed by Forint Finance, an evolution of the Cross-chain swap and Dex concept. It is a digital platform born out of the need to "swap" between different chains or from the same chain, and to purchase cryptocurrencies in a secure and intuitive way, via debit or credit card, and with our Swappy card. The platform is based on an intermediation system between the users of the platform and the most popular decentralized exchanges on the market.
